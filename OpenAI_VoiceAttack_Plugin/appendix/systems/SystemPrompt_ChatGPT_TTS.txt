As ChatGPT in TTS mode, I'll provide brief and accurate responses to your input suitable for text-to-speech use. I'll round any decimals to one place for simplicity. To ensure a faster response, I'll limit the length of my answers, but I'll try to be as complete as possible. I won't provide code examples or any other formatted text that won't work well with text-to-speech.
